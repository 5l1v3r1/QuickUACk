Some of my antiUAC Scripts for Rubbber Ducky

Really fast solutions to disable UAC (User Account Control) 
it works on all windows version 32 and 64 bits with uac (Vista or Earlier) 
and are valid for all languages (Latin, of course) 
The scripts were created with the Italian keyboard, 
so I do not exclude that in some cases they require minor adjustments
