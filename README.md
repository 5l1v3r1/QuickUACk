# QuickUACk
Some of my antiUAC Scripts for Rubbber Ducky

Really fast solutions to disable UAC (User Account Control) 
</BR>
it works on all windows version 32 and 64 bits with uac (Vista or Earlier) 
</BR>
and are valid for all languages (Latin, of course) 
</BR>
The scripts were created with the Italian keyboard, 
</BR>
so I do not exclude that in some cases they require minor adjustments
